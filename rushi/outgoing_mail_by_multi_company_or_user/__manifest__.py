        Outgoing Mail by Multi Company or User
        ======================================

        This module allows you to select the correct outgoing mail server in multi-company or multi-user environments.

        Each outgoing mail server configuration must be linked to **either a company or a user, but not both**. 
        This prevents ambiguity in email routing and ensures that emails are sent using the correct identity.

        Key Features:
        -------------
        - Automatically selects outgoing mail server based on current user or company
        - Supports multi-company setups
        - Avoids duplicate or conflicting mail server use
        - Enforces validation: only one (company or user) allowed per config
